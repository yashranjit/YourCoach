# Purpose of the app:
- This app is about committing to a Block of Time (e.g., "I will work from 6 AM to 11 AM), to do deepwork sessions with breaks in between. 
- User has to select _block of time_, _deepwork time_, and _break time_.
- App will automate breaks and restarting of sessions after the breaks - this will continue till the block time ends.
